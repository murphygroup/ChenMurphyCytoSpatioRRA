This is the reproducible research archive that reproduces all results and figures in the manuscript "CytoSpatio: Learning cell type spatial relationships using multirange, multitype point process models". 

Intermediate results such as cell type assigning were also uploaded. 

Run `bash run_RRA.sh path_to_output` to reproduce all results.
